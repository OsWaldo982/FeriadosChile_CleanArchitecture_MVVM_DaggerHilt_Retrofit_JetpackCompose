Built with the latest tools and libraries, the app offers an interactive and visually appealing experience for users, showcasing holidays with detailed information in a responsive and intuitive interface.

Key Features
Holiday Listings: View a list of public holidays fetched from the Boostr API.
Real-Time Data Fetching: Fetch and display the latest holiday information seamlessly.
Responsive UI: Powered by Jetpack Compose for a highly interactive and modern user interface.
Smooth State Management: Efficiently handle loading states and error scenarios, ensuring a robust user experience.
Ad Integration: Includes non-intrusive ad banners for monetization, ensuring a balance between functionality and user satisfaction.
Tech Stack and Architecture
This project is built with a Clean Architecture and follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern to ensure modularity, scalability, and ease of testing.

Technologies Used
Kotlin: The modern programming language for Android development.
Jetpack Compose: A declarative UI toolkit to build native Android UIs with less code and greater flexibility.
Dagger Hilt: Dependency injection for cleaner and more testable code.
Retrofit: A type-safe HTTP client for seamless API interaction.
Material Design 3 (Material You): Consistent and visually appealing UI design principles.
Clean Architecture: Separation of concerns between the UI, business logic, and data layers.
Project Structure
The project follows a modular structure with clear separation of layers:

Features in Detail
Fetch Holidays:

Connects to the Boostr API using Retrofit.
Parses JSON data into structured Kotlin data classes for seamless integration.
Interactive UI:

Displays holiday details (title, date, type, and additional notes) in a scrollable list using LazyColumn.
Implements loading and error states to handle different scenarios gracefully.
Clean Architecture:

Data Layer: Manages the API calls and caching mechanisms.
Domain Layer: Contains use cases that mediate between the data layer and the UI layer.
UI Layer: Fully composed of Jetpack Compose for a modern and dynamic user interface.
Dependency Injection:

Uses Hilt for managing dependencies, ensuring a clean and testable codebase.
State Management:

Leverages LiveData in ViewModels to observe and update UI states dynamically.
